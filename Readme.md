## About Me

After a solid career of 10 years in the telecommunications area, I decided that after the birth of my son, it would be time to change the area and look for new challenges. Since June 2017, I dedicate my free time to study development, contribute to Open Source projects and improve my English. Currently my studies are focused on Front-end, I have as main programming language Javascript and I ❤️ ReactJS.
I keep my personal codes and projects on Github and I have also developed my blog to put my learning into practice by publishing articles on development. I am also the creator of "Vue Theme", theme with +61100 installs | + 101000 downloads ⬇️  in the Visual Studio Code editor.
